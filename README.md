This program is an application of a concept that we recently learned in MTH419

"The Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups" : 
- Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic
- Also, if |<a>| = n then the order of any subgroup of <a> is a divisor of n
- For each divisor k of n, the group <a> has exactly one subgroup of that order k, namely <a^(n/k)>

This program will output all of the information necessary 
to draw an aesthetically pleasing lattice of the 
subgroups of Zn given a value for n. The group operation is 
assumed to be addition mod n for simplicity.
